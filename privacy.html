        <div class="left-side-content">
            <h3 class="separator dark-text-title mainHead" style="text-align: center;">JACKTRIP PRIVACY POLICY</h3>
            <p class="dark-text font-400" style="text-align: center;"><b style="font-weight: 500;">Effective Date: October 2, 2020</b></p>

            <p class="dark-text font-400">JackTrip Foundation and its affiliate JackTrip Labs, Inc. (collectively, “JackTrip”) are
                committed to protecting the privacy of users of the website at <a href="https://www.jacktrip.org">jacktrip.org</a>
                or any website owned, operated, licensed or controlled by us (the “Website”). The Website offers a web-based
                platform, product, marketplace, application, community, tool, or service (collectively, with the Website, 
                the “Service”), including JackTrip’s open source software platform that helps musicians collaborate remotely. 
                 This Privacy Policy describes how JackTrip gathers and uses information about visitors to our Website 
                 (“Visitors”) and end-users of the Service (“End-users”).  This Privacy Policy applies solely to the information 
                 that we collect through the Website and the Service.  This Privacy Policy does not address personal 
                 information that you provide to us in other contexts (e.g., through a business relationship not handled 
                 through the Website).
            </p>
            <h4 class="separator dark-text main-margin-title-l bottom-margin-rem">Acceptance of Privacy Policy</h4>
            <p class="dark-text font-400">By using the Website or the Service, you signify your acceptance of this Privacy Policy. 
                If you do not agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy, please do not use the Website or the Service. Your 
                continued use of the Website or Service following the posting of changes to these terms will mean that you accept 
                those changes.
            </p>
            
            <h4 class="separator dark-text main-margin-title-l bottom-margin-rem">How Do We Collect Your Personal Information?</h4>
            <p class="dark-text font-400">You may visit our Website without telling us anything about yourself. If you contact us and choose to provide 
                personally identifiable information, such as your name, address, telephone number or e-mail address (“Personal Information”), we will 
                use that information and may share it with other companies and/or individuals (e.g., our partners, consultants, and service providers) 
                for the purpose for which you submitted it to us, such as to respond to your inquiry or to provide you with information that you requested. 
                For example, you may sign up for our newsletter by providing your name and email address on our home page, or by providing your email and 
                password to sign in our Zendesk page available through the Website’s Help page.
            </p>

            <p class="dark-text font-400">You may also provide your email and password in order to (i) access the JackTrip Virtual Studio, which is a web 
                application that automates the configuration, deployment and management of the JackTrip software (the “Software”) over the Internet or 
                (ii) download the Software.
            </p>

            <p class="dark-text font-400">From time to time, our Website may be configured to collect domain information. This data enables us to become 
                more familiar with which users visit our site, how often they visit and what parts of the site they visit most often. JackTrip uses this 
                information to improve our Website. No personally identifiable information is gathered in this process. This information is collected 
                automatically and requires no action on your part.
            </p>

            <h4 class="separator dark-text main-margin-title-l bottom-margin-rem">How Do We Use Your Personal Information?</h4>
            <p class="dark-text font-400">If you choose to provide us with Personal Information by completing a form on the Website or emailing us, we will 
                use that Personal Information to (i) operate the Website, (ii) respond to your question or request, (iii) communicate with you about our 
                products or services via email, (iv) send information to you, and (v) notify you of changes to this Privacy Policy. If you do not wish to 
                receive unsolicited emails or other communications from us, you may contact us at <a href="mailto:support@jacktrip.org">support@jacktrip.org</a> 
                and request that your Personal Information be removed from our list.
            </p>

            <h4 class="separator dark-text main-margin-title-l bottom-margin-rem">Do We Disclose Any Personal Information to Outside Parties?</h4>
            <p class="dark-text font-400">Unless you expressly give us permission in writing to do so, JackTrip will not sell, rent, license, or trade your 
                Personal Information other than as specified in this Privacy Policy.
            </p>

            <p class="dark-text font-400">Disclosures to Third Parties Assisting In Our Operations.  JackTrip may share your Personal Information under 
                confidentiality agreements with other companies that work with, or on behalf of, JackTrip to provide products and services, such as a cloud 
                hosting company or identity verification service.  These companies may use your Personal Information to assist JackTrip in its operations.  
                However, these companies do not have any independent right to share this information.
            </p>

            <p class="dark-text font-400">Disclosures Under Special Circumstances.  We may provide information about you to respond to subpoenas, court orders, 
                legal process or governmental regulations, or to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims.  We believe it is necessary 
                to share information in order to investigate, prevent or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving 
                potential threats to the physical safety of any person, or as otherwise required by law.  In such circumstances, we will take appropriate 
                measures to ensure that the requester understands the sensitive nature of the Personal Information that they may receive.
            </p>

            <p class="dark-text font-400">Business Transfers.  We may share your Personal Information with other business entities in connection with the sale, 
                assignment, merger or other transfer of all or a portion of JackTrip’s business to such business entity.  We will require any such successor 
                business entity to honor the terms of this Privacy Policy.
            </p>



            <h4 class="separator dark-text main-margin-title-l bottom-margin-rem">Automatically Collected Information and Anonymous Information</h4>
            <p class="dark-text font-400">Each time a Visitor comes to the Website, JackTrip collects some information to improve the overall quality of the 
                Visitor’s online experience.
            </p>

            <p class="dark-text font-400">Aggregated Data.  JackTrip collects aggregate queries for internal reporting and also counts, tracks, and aggregates 
                the Visitor’s activity into JackTrip’s analysis of general traffic-flow at the Website.  To these ends, JackTrip may merge information about 
                you into aggregated group data.  In some cases, JackTrip may remove personal identifiers from Personal Information and maintain it in aggregate 
                form that may later be combined with other information to generate anonymous, aggregated statistical information. Such anonymous, group data 
                may be shared on an aggregated basis with JackTrip’s affiliates, business partners, service providers and/or vendors; if it does so, JackTrip 
                will not disclose your individual identity. 
            </p>

            <p class="dark-text font-400">Cookies and Web Beacons.  Periodically, some pages on this Website may use “cookies,” which are small files that the 
                site places on your hard drive for identification purposes. These files are used for site registration and customization the next time you 
                visit us. You should note that cookies cannot read data off of your hard drive. Your web browser may allow you to be notified when you are 
                receiving a cookie, giving you the choice to accept it or not. You can also refuse all cookies by turning them off in your browser. By not 
                accepting cookies, some pages may not fully function and you may not be able to access certain information on this Website.  Information that 
                we collect through cookies includes (i) the name and version of the operating system on the Visitor’s computer, (ii) the name and version of 
                the Visitor’s browser, (iii) which page on the Site the Visitor is currently reading, as well as clicks and time spent on a particular page, 
                (iv) if the Visitor was sent to the current page by some other page on the web, the universal resource locator (“URL”) of the referring web page, 
                and (v) geolocation of the Visitor’s computer or device.  Some of the Site’s web pages may use web beacons in conjunction with cookies to compile 
                aggregate statistics about Site usage.  A web beacon is an electronic image (also referred to as an “action tag,” “single-pixel,” or “clear GIF”)
                that is commonly used to track the traffic patterns of users from one web page to another in order to maximize web traffic flow and to otherwise 
                analyze the effectiveness of the Website.  Some web beacons may be unusable if you elect to reject their associated cookies.
            </p>

            <p class="dark-text font-400" style=" text-decoration: underline;"><b style="font-weight: 600; color: #171221;">By accessing and using the Website, 
                you expressly consent to the storage of cookies, other local storage technologies, 
                beacons or other information on your computer or devices.  You also consent to the access of such cookies, local storage technologies, beacons 
                and information by us.</b>
            </p>

            <h4 class="separator dark-text main-margin-title-l bottom-margin-rem">Security</h4>
            <p class="dark-text font-400">The security of your data is very important to JackTrip. We have implemented appropriate security measures preventing 
                your Personal Information from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorized way, altered or disclosed. However, you should know 
                that no website operator or software provider, including JackTrip, can fully eliminate security risks associated with Personal Information. While 
                JackTrip has endeavored to create a secure and reliable website for users, the confidentiality of any communication or material transmitted 
                to/from the Website or via e-mail cannot be guaranteed.
            </p>


            <h4 class="separator dark-text main-margin-title-l bottom-margin-rem">Children's Privacy Protection</h4>
            <p class="dark-text font-400" style=" text-decoration: underline;">Under Age 13 </p>
            <p class="dark-text font-400">JackTrip understands the importance of protecting children's privacy in the interactive online world. The Website and 
                the Service is not designed for, or intentionally targeted at, children under 13 years of age. It is not our policy to intentionally collect or 
                maintain information about anyone under the age of 13.  No one under the age of 13 should submit any Personal Information to JackTrip, the Website 
                or the Service.
            </p>
            <p class="dark-text font-400" style=" text-decoration: underline;">Under Age 18 </p>
            <p class="dark-text font-400">Minors under 18 years of age may have the Personal Information that they have provided to JackTrip through the Website 
                deleted by sending an email to support@jacktrip.org requesting deletion.  Please note that, while we make reasonable efforts to comply with such 
                requests, deletion of your personal information does not ensure complete and comprehensive removal of that data from all systems.
            </p>

            <h4 class="separator dark-text main-margin-title-l bottom-margin-rem">Response to “Do Not Track” Signals</h4>
            <p class="dark-text font-400">Some Internet browsers include the ability to transmit “Do Not Track” signals.  Since uniform standards for “Do Not Track” 
                signals have not yet been adopted, JackTrip does not process or respond to “Do Not Track” signals.
            </p>

            <h4 class="separator dark-text main-margin-title-l bottom-margin-rem">Updating Your Information</h4>
            <p class="dark-text font-400">If you wish to stop receiving e-mails or other communications from us, or if you have submitted Personal Information 
                through our Website and would like that information deleted from our records, please notify us at <a href="mailto:support@jacktrip.org">support@jacktrip.org</a>.
            </p>


            <h4 class="separator dark-text main-margin-title-l bottom-margin-rem">Links to Third Party Websites</h4>
            <p class="dark-text font-400">As a convenience to our Visitors, this Website may contain links to other sites that we believe may offer useful 
                information. As stated in more detail in the Website Terms of Service, the terms of usage and other conditions of use posted on those sites, 
                and not the policies and procedures we described here, apply to those sites. Your linking to any other websites is at your own risk, and 
                you are responsible for learning about and complying with the terms of usage and other conditions posted on those websites.  
            </p>

            <h4 class="separator dark-text main-margin-title-l bottom-margin-rem">Changes to this Privacy Policy</h4>
            <p class="dark-text font-400">This Privacy Policy may be revised from time to time as we add new features and services, as laws change, and as 
                industry privacy and security best practices evolve.  We display an effective date on the policy in the upper right corner of this Privacy 
                Policy so that it will be easier for you to know when there has been a change.  If we make any change to this Privacy Policy regarding use 
                or disclosure of Personal Information, we will provide advance notice on the Website.  Small changes or changes that do not significantly 
                affect individual privacy interests may be made at any time and without prior notice.
            </p>

            <h4 class="separator dark-text main-margin-title-l bottom-margin-rem">For Additional Information</h4>
