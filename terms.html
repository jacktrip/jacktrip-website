                JackTrip may, at any time and without

            </p>

            <h4 class="separator dark-text main-margin-title-l bottom-margin-rem">5. Disclaimer - Warranty</h4>
            <p class="dark-text font-400">THE SITE, ITS CONTENT, MATERIALS, SERVICES AND PRODUCTS ON THE SITE ARE PROVIDED "AS IS."  TO THE FULLEST

                or error-free, that the defects will be corrected, or that the Website or the server that makes the Website available are free 
                of viruses or other harmful components. JackTrip does not make any warranties or representations regarding the use of the
                materials in the Website in terms of their correctness, accuracy, adequacy, usefulness, timeliness, reliability or otherwise. 
                Some states do not permit limitations or exclusions on warranties, so the above limitations may not apply to you.
            </p>

            <h4 class="separator dark-text main-margin-title-l bottom-margin-rem">6. Indemnification</h4>
            <p class="dark-text font-400">You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless JackTrip, its officers, directors, employees, agents, 
                licensors and suppliers from and against all losses, expenses, damages and costs, including reasonable attorneys' fees, resulting

            <p class="dark-text font-400">YOUR USE OF THE SITE IS AT YOUR OWN RISK.  NEITHER JACKTRIP, NOR ANY OF ITS SUBSIDIARIES, AFFILIATES, 
                OFFICERS OR DIRECTORS, NOR ANY OF ITS AGENTS OR ANY OTHER PARTY INVOLVED IN CREATING, PRODUCING, OR DELIVERING THE SITE OR ITS 
                CONTENT, ARE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, PUNITIVE, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR OTHER DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF OR 
                IN ANY WAY CONNECTED WITH THE USE OF THE SITE, WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT, STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHERWISE, EVEN IF ADVISED 
                OF THE POSSIBILITY OF ANY SUCH DAMAGES. Some states do not permit limitations or exclusions on warranties, so the above 
                limitations may not apply to you.
            </p>

            <h4 class="separator dark-text main-margin-title-l bottom-margin-rem">8. Third-Party Links</h4>
            <p class="dark-text font-400">In an attempt to provide increased value to our visitors, JackTrip may link to sites operated by third 
                parties. However, even if the third party is affiliated with JackTrip, JackTrip has no control over these linked sites, all of 
                which may have separate terms and conditions of use, independent of JackTrip.  These linked sites are only for your convenience 
                and therefore you access them at your own risk.  Without limiting the foregoing, JackTrip specifically disclaims any responsibility 
                if such sites: (i) infringe any third party's intellectual property rights; (ii) are inaccurate, incomplete or misleading; 
                (iii) are not merchantable or fit for a particular purpose; (iv) do not provide adequate security; (v) contain viruses or other 
                items of a destructive nature; or (vi) are libelous or defamatory.
            </p>

            <p class="dark-text font-400">JackTrip does not endorse the content, or any products or services available, on such sites.  Nonetheless, 
                JackTrip seeks to protect the integrity of its website and the links placed upon it and therefore requests any feedback on not only 
                this Website, but for sites it links to as well (including if a specific link does not work).

            <h4 class="separator dark-text main-margin-title-l bottom-margin-rem">13. Dispute Resolution</h4>
            <p class="dark-text font-400">Any controversy or claim between the parties or arising out of these Terms of Use or any use of the Website 
                shall be determined by one disinterested arbitrator in binding arbitration pursuant to the Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary 
                Procedures for Online Arbitration of the American Arbitration Association (the “AAA”). The arbitrator shall be experienced in agreements for 
                information technology services, either as an attorney or as an information technology professional. If the parties fail to appoint an 
                arbitrator within forty-five (45) days of the institution of the arbitration, the AAA shall select the arbitrator promptly thereafter. 
                Any requests for accelerated, emergency or preliminary relief shall be submitted pursuant to the AAA’s Optional Rules for Emergency 
                Measures of Protection. If any such requests are made before an arbitration panel is empaneled, then the AAA shall appoint one disinterested 
                arbitrator as an arbitration panel to immediately hear and decide such request. The arbitration panel shall have the right to grant 
                interim awards. Testimony shall be permitted by telephone, video conference and other forms of real-time telecommunications. 
                If the arbitrator requires in-person hearings, the hearings shall be held in Palo Alto, California. The arbitral award will be final 
                and binding, and may be entered and enforced in any court of competent jurisdiction.
            </p>


            <h4 class="separator dark-text main-margin-title-l bottom-margin-rem">14. Waiver of Jury Trial and Class Actions</h4>
            <p class="dark-text font-400">BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS OF USE, YOU AND JACKTRIP ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE TO WAIVE CERTAIN RIGHTS TO LITIGATE 
                DISPUTES IN COURT, TO RECEIVE A JURY TRIAL OR TO PARTICIPATE AS A PLAINTIFF OR AS A CLASS MEMBER IN ANY CLAIM ON A CLASS OR CONSOLIDATED 
                BASIS OR IN A REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY. YOU AND JACKTRIP BOTH AGREE THAT ANY ARBITRATION WILL BE CONDUCTED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT 
                A CONSOLIDATED, CLASS-WIDE OR REPRESENTATIVE BASIS AND THE ARBITRATOR SHALL HAVE NO AUTHORITY TO PROCEED WITH AN ARBITRATION ON A CLASS 
                OR REPRESENTATIVE BASIS. THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD INJUNCTIVE RELIEF ONLY IN FAVOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL PARTY SEEKING RELIEF AND ONLY TO 
                THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE RELIEF WARRANTED BY THAT PARTY’S INDIVIDUAL CLAIM. IF FOR ANY REASON THE ARBITRATION CLAUSE SET FORTH 
                IN THESE TERMS OF USE IS DEEMED INAPPLICABLE OR INVALID, OR TO THE EXTENT THE ARBITRATION CLAUSE ALLOWS FOR LITIGATION OF DISPUTES IN 
                COURT, YOU AND JACKTRIP BOTH WAIVE, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT ALLOWED BY LAW, ANY RIGHT TO PURSUE OR TO PARTICIPATE AS A PLAINTIFF OR AS A 
                CLASS MEMBER IN ANY CLAIM ON A CLASS OR CONSOLIDATED BASIS OR IN A REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY.
            </p>

            <h4 class="separator dark-text main-margin-title-l bottom-margin-rem">18. Survival</h4>
            <p class="dark-text font-400">The provisions of these Terms of Use entitled “Disclaimer - Warranty,” “Indemnification,” “Limitation of Liability,” 
                Dispute Resolution,” “Waiver of Jury Trial and Class Actions, “Law and Jurisdiction” and “General Provisions” will survive the termination of

            <h4 class="separator dark-text main-margin-title-l bottom-margin-rem">19. General Provisions</h4>
            <p class="dark-text font-400">Except as provided in a particular “Legal Notice” on this Website, these Terms of Use, along with the JackTrip Privacy

                contemporaneous communications with JackTrip. These Terms of Use are severable, and in the event any provision is determined to be invalid or 
                unenforceable, such invalidity or unenforceability shall not in any way affect the validity or enforceability of the remaining provisions. 
                A printed version of these Terms of Use shall be admissible in judicial or administrative proceedings based upon or relating to use of the 
                Website to the same extent and subject to the same conditions as other business documents and records originally generated and maintained 
                in printed form. The section titles of this Agreement are displayed for convenience only and have no legal effect. Nothing in this Agreement 
                shall be deemed to confer any third-party rights or benefit.
